# üìö VoiceFAQ: A Local LLM-Powered Voice-Enabled FAQ Assistant

This project is a voice-interactive FAQ assistant powered by a local Hugging Face language model. It allows users to upload a `.txt` document (such as policies or FAQs), index its content using semantic embeddings and FAISS, and ask questions using either text or voice. The assistant will respond in text and optionally via text-to-speech.
